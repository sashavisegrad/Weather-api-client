# Weather-api-client
<h1>Not made for use it!</h1>
<p>A client for a weather API made in Go. This project is done by practicing purposes and not for a serious project so may not be perfect </p>
<h2> How to use it</h2>
<p>Run the main.go file and then open your browser, go to the http://localhost:3000 and the direction seen in the terminal and just do nothing. I'm proud of this anyways</p>
